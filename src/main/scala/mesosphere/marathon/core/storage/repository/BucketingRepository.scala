/**
  * Fun fact about Zookeeper: you can create a lot of children nodes but if you  try to get all of them by calling
  * [[mesosphere.marathon.core.storage.zookeeper.ZooKeeperPersistenceStore.children()]] (on the parent node) you are likely
  * to get:
  * ```
  * java.io.IOException: Packet len20800020 is out of range!
  *  at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocket.readLength(ClientCnxnSocket.java:112)
  *  ...
  * ```
  *
  * Turns out that ZK has a packet length limit which is 4096 * 1024 bytes by default:
  * https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/0cb4011dac7ec28637426cafd98b4f8f299ef61d/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/client/ZKClientConfig.java#L58
  *
  * It can be altered by setting `jute.maxbuffer` environment variable. Packet in this context is an application level
  * packet containing all the children. Some experimentation showed that each child element in that packet has ~4bytes
  * overhead for encoding. So, let's say each child node name is 50 characters long (seems like a good guess given 3-4
  * levels of nesting e.g. `eng_dev_databases_my-favourite-mysql-instance`), we could only have:
  * 4096 * 1024 / (50 + 4) =  ~75k children nodes. Well, we could have more, but reading all the at once won't work.
  *
  *
  * This trait solves the above mentioned limitations by putting the elements into buckets. Each element is then
  * stored in `/$basePath/$bucket/$relative/element/path`. This way the total number of possible elements is
  * NumberOfBuckets * MaxElementsPerBucket where later parameter depends on the length of children node name (see
  * calculation above)
  * Every element passed should implement [[BucketNode]] trait that defines the hash of the bucket where the element is stored
  * and the relative path below.
  *
  * Same goes for reading elements - one need to pass a [[BucketPath]] which defines bucket hash along with the element
  * relative path.
